  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of sensor fusion in the context of visual localization, namely the combined usage of multiple vision sensors and visual odometry sources to estimate the position and orientation of an autonomous agent moving into an unknown environment. Focusing on the case of a redundant sensor configuration consisting of many data sources that may also inform about their functioning state, the essential characteristics of visual sensors are recalled, and an effective fusion system is developed. Its two-fold goal is to improve the overall estimate by combining the strengths of potentially different sensors, also adding fault resilience, while allowing for a simple implementation that relies on little information. A test setup that represents a realistic configuration of an autonomous robot is described, and the experimental results are presented and discussed.}

  abstract = {A novel distributed control architecture for unmanned aircraft system (UASs) based on the new Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 middleware is proposed, endowed with industrial-grade tools that establish a novel standard for high-reliability distributed systems. The architecture has been developed for an autonomous quadcopter to design an inclusive solution ranging from low-level sensor management and soft real-time operating system setup and tuning to perception, exploration, and navigation modules orchestrated by a finite-state machine. The architecture proposed in this study builds on ROS 2 with its scalability and soft real-time communication functionalities, while including security and safety features, optimised implementations of localisation algorithms, and integrating an innovative and flexible path planner for UASs. Finally, experimental results have been collected during tests carried out both in the laboratory and in a realistic environment, showing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of reliability, scalability, and flexibility.},

The observer design utilizes two different methodologies; a Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD) and a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) method. We prove that, under the proposed solutions, the boundedness of the estimation error is guaranteed. The performance of the observer is evaluated and compared to a standard EKF using comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of dynamic input allocation in the presence of plant uncertainties. The current state of the art shows how to design an Allocator as the cascade of an Optimizer and an Annihilator to achieve steady-state input optimality and output invisibility simultaneously. This work proposes a novel algorithm based on polynomial factorization to design a dynamic Annihilator. The critical aspect of this approach lies in the assumption of the perfect plant knowledge, making the Annihilator not robust to uncertainties. A robustification process is introduced by optimizing its design parameters. This approach is formulated as a model-matching problem aiming to reduce the output mismatch induced by the allocation scheme while maintaining steady-state optimality. As the numerical simulations highlight, this method applies to linear and nonlinear allocation problems.}

  abstract = {This paper presents two innovative approaches to design symbolic controllers for dynamical systems. The first novelty involves a new trajectory-based strategy for defining the states of a symbolic model, which provides a more accurate representation of the system's dynamics than the traditional grid-based technique. The second novelty concerns using a Bounded-parameter Markov Decision Process rather than a Finite Transition System to model the behavior of a symbolic model. This procedure allows for handling the system's stochastic behavior and considers uncertainties. The effectiveness of the novel approaches presented is demonstrated through numerical results.},

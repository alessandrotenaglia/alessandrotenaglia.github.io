abstract: This paper presents a study on developing a hybrid 3D position observer
  for a rover with acceleration and relative distance measurements. The observer design
  utilizes two different methodologies; a Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD)
  and a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) method. We prove that, under the proposed solutions,
  the boundedness of the estimation error is guaranteed. The performance of the observer
  is evaluated and compared to a standard EKF using comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations.

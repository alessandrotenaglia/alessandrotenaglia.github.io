abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dynamic input allocation in the presence
  of plant uncertainties. The current state of the art shows how to design an Allocator
  as the cascade of an Optimizer and an Annihilator to achieve steady-state input
  optimality and output invisibility simultaneously. This work proposes a novel algorithm
  based on polynomial factorization to design a dynamic Annihilator. The critical
  aspect of this approach lies in the assumption of the perfect plant knowledge, making
  the Annihilator not robust to uncertainties. A robustification process is introduced
  by optimizing its design parameters. This approach is formulated as a model-matching
  problem aiming to reduce the output mismatch induced by the allocation scheme while
  maintaining steady-state optimality. As the numerical simulations highlight, this
  method applies to linear and nonlinear allocation problems.

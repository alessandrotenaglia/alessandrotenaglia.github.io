abstract: A novel distributed control architecture for unmanned aircraft system (UASs)
  based on the new Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 middleware is proposed, endowed
  with industrial-grade tools that establish a novel standard for high-reliability
  distributed systems. The architecture has been developed for an autonomous quadcopter
  to design an inclusive solution ranging from low-level sensor management and soft
  real-time operating system setup and tuning to perception, exploration, and navigation
  modules orchestrated by a finite-state machine. The architecture proposed in this
  study builds on ROS 2 with its scalability and soft real-time communication functionalities,
  while including security and safety features, optimised implementations of localisation
  algorithms, and integrating an innovative and flexible path planner for UASs. Finally,
  experimental results have been collected during tests carried out both in the laboratory
  and in a realistic environment, showing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture
  in terms of reliability, scalability, and flexibility.

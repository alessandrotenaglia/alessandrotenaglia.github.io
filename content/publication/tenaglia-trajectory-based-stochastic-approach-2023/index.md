abstract: This paper presents two innovative approaches to design symbolic controllers
  for dynamical systems. The first novelty involves a new trajectory-based strategy
  for defining the states of a symbolic model, which provides a more accurate representation
  of the system's dynamics than the traditional grid-based technique. The second novelty
  concerns using a Bounded-parameter Markov Decision Process rather than a Finite
  Transition System to model the behavior of a symbolic model. This procedure allows
  for handling the system's stochastic behavior and considers uncertainties. The effectiveness
  of the novel approaches presented is demonstrated through numerical results.
